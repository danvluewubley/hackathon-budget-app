          Budgeting Made Simple (BMS) is a user-friendly budgeting app designed
          specifically for first-generation families in New York to manage their
          finances effectively. BMS has budgeting features giving the individual
          a plan to handle their spendings. Users can customize the percentages
          given to each category, such as retirement, living expenses, savings,
          and more! BMS has a tax calculator that gives a
          <span>rough</span> estimate of their remaining income after tax. The
          tax calculations we created are more accurate for families with an
          income less than $100,000 per year in New York. As the income
          increases above $100,000 or youâ€™re outside of New York, the tax
          calculation becomes less accurate. When using this app, please give
          the tax calculation a <span>10% margin of error</span> regardless of your income.
